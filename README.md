# database-driven-ui

An app that fetches data remotely from the GitHub Jobs API, persists it in a local SQLite database, then queries that
data to be displayed in a ListView. Inspired by AAC NetworkBoundResource in that it publishes data progress events 
as asynchronous work in the background continues.

Uses provider and sqflite.
